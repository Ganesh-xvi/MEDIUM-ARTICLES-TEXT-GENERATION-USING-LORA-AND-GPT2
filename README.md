# Medium Articles Text Generation Using LoRA and GPT2




## Project Overview

The project aims to fine-tune a GPT-2 language model for text generation using LoRA (Local Representation Alignment) and apply it to generate text based on given prompts. The model is trained on a dataset containing Medium articles, which is cleaned and tokenized before training. The fine-tuning process involves configuring the GPT-2 model with custom settings for LoRA, setting up parameters for training, and evaluating the model's performance using the perplexity score.

The fine-tuned model is then saved for future use and integrated into a text generation pipeline. This pipeline allows users to input text prompts and receive generated text output based on the trained model's predictions. The project demonstrates a practical application of advanced natural language processing techniques for text generation tasks.

Overall, the project showcases the process of fine-tuning a language model for specific text generation tasks, highlighting the use of techniques like LoRA to improve the model's performance and the implementation of a text generation pipeline for practical use cases.
## Methodology 

- Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of Medium articles for training the GPT-2 model. This dataset should be large enough to capture a diverse range of topics and writing styles.

- Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by removing special characters, URLs, mentions, and other irrelevant information. Tokenize the text data using the GPT-2 tokenizer to prepare it for training.

- Model Configuration: Configure the GPT-2 model with custom settings for LoRA, including the LoRA alpha value, dropout rate, and other parameters.

- Model Training: Fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the preprocessed dataset using the SFTTrainer, which handles the training loop and evaluation. Use a portion of the dataset for training and another portion for evaluation to assess the model's performance.

- Evaluation: Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance using metrics such as perplexity score on the test dataset. This metric indicates how well the model predicts the next word in a sequence, with lower scores indicating better performance.

- Text Generation Pipeline: Implement a text generation pipeline using the fine-tuned model, allowing users to input prompts and receive generated text outputs. This pipeline should provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.

- Results Analysis: Analyze the results of the fine-tuned model, including generated text examples and performance metrics. Evaluate the model's effectiveness in generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
## Conclusion 

This project showcases the effective fine-tuning of a GPT-2 language model using LoRA for text generation tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of Medium articles, demonstrating the importance of data preprocessing and tokenization for training. The fine-tuned model achieves a perplexity score of approximately 8764.61 on the test dataset, indicating its ability to predict the next word in a sequence.

The project highlights the practical applications of the fine-tuned model, including content generation, chatbot development, text summarization, and creative writing assistance. It also emphasizes the model's potential for content personalization and language translation tasks.

Overall, this project demonstrates the versatility and effectiveness of fine-tuning transformer-based models like GPT-2 for a variety of natural language processing tasks, paving the way for more advanced and context-aware text generation applications.
